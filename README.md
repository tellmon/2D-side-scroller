Task Description:

Create a design decision document for a new 2D side scrolling platform game (aim to get sued by Nintendo for ripping off Mario Bros 3!). 

You should include:

    A short paragraph outlining the overall game. This is the pitch that you would give to someone to explain your game at a party or to get them to give you money!
    A sketch of the game visual to allow us to see your vision (coloured pencils please)
    A UML diagram of the class structure for all the elements of the game. You're not making it, but should be able to justify why you have chosen to make it like that - why abstract class extended, why encapsulation and where, why aggregation or composition? why? 


you will be giving a powerpoint presentation - please think carefully about the visuals you put on your presentations and the size of the text!
