map as a text file

Sprite:
- abstract
- x and y pos
- height and width
- draw self
- move sprite right or left based of if moving every tick

nonMoveIngSprite: extends Sprite

EnmmySprite as they all move based of the game timer/ animation timer extends Sprite

- animate
- speed level
- jumping level
- hunger level
- well being


player - the person the player plays as. 
- amount of money it has. 
- games played
- amount won

controller class given to a player class as a extend
